\## PERSONAL SUMMARY

As a Marine Corps veteran, I bring a unique perspective and set of skills to the table. During my four years of service, I

had the opportunity to travel and work as an engineer, which allowed me to develop problem-solving and analytical

skills that I believe are highly valuable in any field, especially in a technology role. After leaving the military, I enrolled

in Emory University’s Pre-Med Program and since transferred to Kennesaw State University where I am majoring in

Computer Science. Through these experiences, I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in Python, Java, Linux,

and more that I am eager to apply in a professional setting where I hope to provide my diverse set of knowledge.

\## TECHNICAL SKILLS

**Programming:** Python, JavaScript, Java, Bash

\## PROJECTS

\- I wanted to use a tech stack that was organized, where I can prevent unauthorized access to the user route, and to make

    it dynamic in nature so I utilized Handlebars template engine, Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas for the database and

    passport for authentication. Users can post locations within certain cities and be able to interact with them.
