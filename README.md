# Team 7 - Intro to SWE Project

Welcome to the Team 7 class project repository for SWE 3313, Introduction to Software Engineering. Our documents, source code, and presentations throughout the project will be located here, with links to each document and presentation in this README markdown file. This repository and README file will be updated accordingly as the project progresses.

Our project will be an e-commerce site built with ASP.NET Core Blazor, with the data being stored with SQLite, that sells used cars to users, and would contain an administration side of the site to manage the inventory and view sales reports. Please have a look at our extensive documentation and planning process within this repository, as well as our source code to view our implementation.

Meet our Team:

- [Justin Owen](https://github.com/justin-owen/SWE3313Project/blob/main/Justin%20Owen%20Resume.md)
- [William Lane](https://github.com/justin-owen/SWE3313Project/blob/main/William%20Lane%20Resume.md)
- [Pierre Lopez Orama](https://github.com/justin-owen/SWE3313Project/blob/main/PierreLopezOramaResume.md)
- [Antonio Kinsler](https://github.com/justin-owen/SWE3313Project/blob/main/Antonio%20Kinsler%20Resume.md)

We initially started out discussing our previous experiences to make an informed decision on what tech stack we should utilize. From there, we branched off to the project premise of what we are selling and defined each of our roles for the duration of the project.
