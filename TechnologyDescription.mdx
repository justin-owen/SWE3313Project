# Technology Description

1. We decided to develop our project using C #. Although not all of us have extensive knowledge of the language, we felt it was similar to Java and widely used in the current market.
2. We decided to use Blazor Server as a framework, where we based our decision on user reviews. Most users saw Blazor as Intuitive, as it combines client-side Interaction with server-side rendering in a single programming model.

3. Our storage plan is to utilize SQLite, which we decided on due to members of our team having pre-existing experience. SQLite also meshes well with Blazor Server.
