**William**: **Hello Mr. Jeff Adkison, thank you for contracting team 7 to work on your web based sales system. I am William Lane, and I am going to walk you through our drafted project plan for the ealy design and project track for your product. To start with, we have this Github repository to store all our work and documentation. If you have any further questions following this video, I highly, highly recommend, aside from asking our team, you check there. Everything we have worked on so far is thoroughly logged. Lets take a quick look.** 

Scroll down to the README.md

**William**: **Here we have a little overview of the project, as well as a little bit of information about the team. We plan to create an E-commerce site for used cars. Our top priority is the sale of cars your business owns, but we have some stretch goals to allow users to sell their cars to you or perhaps to other site users. These are links to our tailored resumes. Let's take a look at Mr. Owens' real quick.**

Pierre and Antonio are gonna be our back end guys, which will focus on all the storage and the math. These are very loose roles, and we foresee a lot of overlap in responsibility as the development  cycle moves forward.**

**William: Here we have a list of what we intend to use. The plan is to use Microsoft's C# Blazor Server Framework in conjunction with SQLite database engine. We decided to go with Blazor because according to user reviews it has a lot of useful tools, and it also primarily relies on C#, which is a language most of our team is comfortable with. We will also be implementing Bootstrap CSS to help speed up the front end implementation. Our current target operating system is Windows, with hopes for access across all platforms.**

William: You should have been granted access by a team member earlier this week so you can go over the details in your own time. For a quick look, most of the project plan portion of our timeline is already complete. These presentations all take place at the end of each cycle, as a sort of capstone overview of what was accomplished. We also have our requirements, UI Design, Technical Design, and Implementation in the
